Michael Feathers' desciption of what is not a unit test.

A test is not a unit test if:
-It talks to the database
-It communicates across the network
-It touches the file system
-It can't run at the same time as any of your other unit tests
-You have to do special things to your environment (such as editing config files) to run it.
